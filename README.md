🏆 FIFA World Cup Data Analysis
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes FIFA World Cup data to uncover insights about matches, goals, teams, and player performance. Using Python’s data science libraries, the notebook explores trends, visualizes patterns, and calculates key statistics like mean, median, and correlations.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

NumPy – Numerical computation

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains records of FIFA World Cup matches including:

Year & Host Country

Teams & Scores

Match Stage (Group, Quarterfinal, etc.)

Goals Scored, Wins, and Performance Stats

(You can replace this section with details about your specific dataset once finalized.)

🔍 Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization using:

Histogram – Goals distribution

Bar Chart – Team performance comparison

Pie Chart – Win percentage

Scatter Plot – Goals vs Match outcomes

Box Plot – Goal spread per tournament

Heatmap – Correlation between features

Calculations of mean, median, mode, and insights

Observations and conclusions from visual patterns

📈 Example Visuals

Distribution of total goals per year

Most successful teams by wins

Goal trends over time

Correlation heatmap of performance metrics

🧩 Key Insights

Teams with higher possession and pass accuracy often reach later stages

Goal-scoring trends have evolved across decades

Certain host nations show home advantage in performance
